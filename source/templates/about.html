              <p>We are witnessing a flourishing of innovative ways to tackle society’s problems together—from civic tech to crowdsourcing to nudges to open data. Yet little is known what actually works, when, why, and under what conditions. At the same time, existing research findings are dispersed across innumerable sources, many of which have restricted access.</p>
              <p>As the interest in open governance grows and expands, identifying the signal in the noise—i.e., getting a better sense of what innovations really have an impact and why—will grow increasingly challenging but also increasingly important.</p>

              <p><strong>The Open Governance Research Exchange (OGRX)</strong> seeks to solve this problem by curating and making accessible a diversity of findings on innovating governance.</p>
