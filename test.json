In this article, it is argued that ‘nudging’ represents a distinct (fifth) mode of governance. The effectiveness of nudging as a means of bringing about lasting behaviour change is questioned and it is argued that evidence for its success ignores the facts that many successful nudges are not in fact nudges; that there are instances when nudges backfire; and that there may be ethical concerns associated with nudges. Instead, and in contrast to nudging, behaviour change is more likely to be enduring where it involves social identity change and norm internalisation. The article concludes by urging public policy scholars to engage with the social identity literature on ‘social influence’, and the idea that those promoting lasting behaviour change need to engage with people not as individual cognitive misers, but as members of groups whose norms they internalise and enact.","path":"c81e728d9d4c2f636f067f89cc14862c-why-a-nudge-is-not-enough-a-social-identity-critique-of-governanceby-stealth.html"},{"id":"ea5d2f1c4608232e07d3aa3d998e5135","related_content":[{"url":"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2617481","title":""}],"access":"Open","title":"Fifty Shades of Manipulation","organization":false,"authors":["Cass R.

One problem with manipulation, thus understood, is that it fails to respect people’s autonomy and is an affront to their dignity. Another problem is that if they are products of manipulation, people’s choices might fail to promote their own welfare, and might instead promote the welfare of the manipulator. To that extent, the central objection to manipulation is rooted in a version of Mill’s Harm Principle: People know what is in their best interests and should have a (manipulation-free) opportunity to make that decision. On welfarist grounds, the norm against manipulation can be seen as a kind of heuristic, one that generally works well, but that can also lead to serious errors, at least when the manipulator is both informed and genuinely interested in the welfare of the chooser. \n\nFor the legal system, a pervasive puzzle is why manipulation is rarely policed. The simplest answer is that manipulation has so many shades, and in a social order that values free markets and is committed to freedom of expression, it is exceptionally difficult to regulate manipulation as such. But as the manipulator’s motives become more self-interested or venal, and as efforts to bypass people’s deliberative capacities becomes more successful, the ethical objections to manipulation become very forceful, and the argument for a legal response is fortified. The analysis of manipulation bears on emerging first amendment issues raised by compelled speech, especially in the context of graphic health warnings. Importantly, it can also help orient the regulation of financial products, where manipulation of consumer choices is an evident but rarely explicit concern.","path":"ea5d2f1c4608232e07d3aa3d998e5135-fifty-shades-of-manipulation.html"},{"id":"73278a4a86960eeb576a8fd4c9ec6997","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Closed","title":"Inside the Nudge Unit: How small changes can make a big difference","organization":false,"authors":["David Halpern"],"paper_date":"8/27/2015","url":"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/1108284/inside-the-nudge-unit/9780753551387/","taxonomy":{"category":["Behavioral Science and Nudges"],"objective":["Effectiveness"],"methodology":["Case Studies"]},"sector":false,"region":"united-kingdom","type":"book","tools":"","github":"","abstract":"Behavioural scientist Dr David Halpern heads up Number 10’s ‘Nudge Unit’, the world’s first government institution that uses behavioural economics to examine and influence human behaviour, to ‘nudge’ us into making better decisions.

Despite the recent surge of behavioral analysis in European academia, a scrutiny of decisions by courts and regulatory agencies in the US and the EU reveals striking differences. While in the US rulings by courts and regulatory agencies progressively take insights from behavioral economics into account, EU courts and agencies still, and even increasingly, cling to the rational actor model. These inverse trends can be uncovered in the interpretation of legal concepts of human agency, ie, of those elements in a legal order which refer, implicitly or explicitly, to a model of rationality of human actors. More particularly, this paper reviews the concepts of consumers and of users, in consumer law and product liability respectively, to underscore the claim of the behavioral divide. Importantly, the divergence between EU and US private law practice calls for a normative evaluation. In the face of empirical uncertainty about the existence, direction and intensity of biases, the most attractive legal concept of human agency is a pluralistic one, assuming the simultaneous presence of boundedly and fully rational actors. In concrete applications, this paper shows that a pluralistic perspective urges a revision of the concept of the reasonable consumer, both in US and EU consumer law. Furthermore, such a view leads to the adoption of a more boundedly rational user concept in product liability. The pluralistic, yet more boundedly rational concepts thus have far-reaching consequences both for private law theory and its concomitant case law.","path":"3def184ad8f4755ff269862ea77393dd-the-behavioral-divide-a-critique-of-the-differential-implementation-of-behavioral-law-and-economics-in-the-us-and-the-eu.html"},{"id":"e00da03b685a0dd18fb6a08af0923de0","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Open","title":"Behavioral Political Economy: A Survey","organization":false,"authors":["Jan Schnellenbach","Christian Schubert"],"paper_date":"2014","url":"https://ideas.repec.org/p/ces/ceswps/_4988.html","taxonomy":{"category":["Behavioral Science and Nudges"],"objective":["Effectiveness"],"methodology":["Conceptual Framework"]},"sector":false,"region":false,"type":"journal-article","tools":"","github":"","abstract":"Explaining individual behavior in politics should rely on the same motivational assumptions as explaining behavior in the market: That’s what Political Economy, understood as the application of economics to the study of political processes, is all about.

The theory of libertarian paternalism originally advanced by Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein, and given further defense by Sunstein alone, is itself just a sexy ad campaign designed to nudge gullible readers into thinking that there is no conflict between libertarianism and welfare utilitarianism. But no one should lose sight of the fact that welfare utilitarianism just is welfare utilitarianism only if it sacrifices individual liberty whenever it is at odds with maximizing societal welfare. And thus no one who believes that people have rights to craft their own lives through the exercise of their own choices ought to be duped into thinking that just because paternalistic nudges are cleverly manipulative and often invisible, rather than overtly coercive, standard welfare utilitarianism can lay claim to being libertarian. \n\nAfter outlining four distinct strains of libertarian theory and sketching their mutual incompatibility with so-called “libertarian paternalism,” I go on to demonstrate at some length how the two most prevalent strains — namely, opportunity set libertarianism and motivational libertarianism — make paternalistically-motivated nudges abuses of state power. As I argue, opportunity set libertarians should recognize nudges for what they are — namely, state incursions into the sphere of liberty in which individual choice is a matter of moral right, the boundaries of which are rightly defined, in part, by permissions to do actions that do not maximize welfare. And motivational libertarians should similarly recognize nudges for what they are — namely, illicitly motivated forms of legislative intervention that insult autonomy no less than do flat bans that leave citizens with no choice but to substitute the state’s agenda for their own. As I conclude, whatever its name, a political theory that recommends to state officials the use of “nudges” as means of ensuring that citizens’ advance the state’s understanding of their own best interests is no more compatible with libertarianism than is a theory that recommends more coercive means of paternalism.","path":"9872ed9fc22fc182d371c3e9ed316094-fudging-nudging-why-libertarian-paternalism-is-the-contradiction-it-claims-its-not.html"},{"id":"31fefc0e570cb3860f2a6d4b38c6490d","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Open","title":"Gamification and Sustainable Consumption: Overcoming the Limitations of Persuasive Technologies","organization":false,"authors":["Martina Z.

The goods and services we consume cause resource extractions, greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental impacts that are already affecting the conditions of living on Earth. To support the transition toward sustainable consumption patterns, ICT applications that persuade consumers to change their behavior into a “green” direction have been developed in the field of Persuasive Technology (PT). Such persuasive systems, however, have been criticized for two reasons. First, they are often based on the assumption that information (e.g., information on individual energy consumption) causes behavior change, or a change in awareness and attitude that then changes behavior. Second, PT approaches assume that the designer of the system starts from objective criteria for “sustainable” behavior and is able to operationalize them in the context of the application.\r\n\nIn this chapter, we are exploring the potential of gamification to overcome the limitations of persuasive systems. Gamification, the process of using game elements in a non-game context, opens up a broader design space for ICT applications created to support sustainable consumption. In particular, a gamification-based approach may give the user more autonomy in selecting goals and relating individual action to social interaction. The idea of gamification may also help designers to view the user’s actions in a broader context and to recognize the relevance of different motivational aspects of social interaction, such as competition and cooperation. Based on this discussion we define basic requirements to be used as guidance in gamification- based motivation design for sustainable consumption.","path":"31fefc0e570cb3860f2a6d4b38c6490d-gamification-and-sustainable-consumption-overcoming-the-limitations-of-persuasive-technologies.html"},{"id":"077e29b11be80ab57e1a2ecabb7da330","related_content":[{"url":"","title":""}],"access":"Closed","title":"The Last Mile: Creating Social and Economic Value from Behavioral Insights","organization":false,"authors":["Dilip Soman"],"paper_date":"2015","url":"http://www.utppublishing.com/The-Last-Mile-Creating-Social-and-Economic-Value-from-Behavioral-Insights.html","taxonomy":{"category":["Behavioral Science and Nudges"],"objective":["Effectiveness"],"methodology":["Conceptual Framework","Qualitative Analysis"]},"sector":false,"region":false,"type":"book","tools":"","github":"","abstract":"Most organizations spend much of their effort on the start of the value creation process: namely, creating a strategy, developing new products or services, and analyzing the market.

Such interventions form the core of Sunstein’s philosophy of \"libertarian paternalism,\" which seeks to improve on individuals’ decisions while preserving their freedom to choose. In \"Why Nudge?\", Sunstein forcefully defends libertarian paternalism against John Stuart Mill’s famous Harm Principle, which holds that government should only coerce a person when it is acting to prevent harm to others. Sunstein urges that unlike more coercive measures, nudges respect subjects’ goals, even as they reshape their choices. Using an analogy to voting paradoxes, this review shows that reconciling multiple, inconsistent goals is a fundamentally challenging problem; the challenge leaves even deliberative individuals vulnerable to manipulation through nudges. The fact of inconsistent goals means that government regulators who deploy nudges select and impose their own objectives, instead of merely advancing the goals of the regulated. The analogy also highlights that multimember legislative bodies are subject to many of the same quirks as individuals, raising questions about the government’s ability to improve on individuals’ choices.","path":"7a614fd06c325499f1680b9896beedeb-who-are-you-calling-irrational.html"}]
